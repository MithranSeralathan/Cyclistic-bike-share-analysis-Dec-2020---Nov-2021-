# Cyclistic-bike-share-analysis-Dec-2020---Nov-2021-
This case study serves as the capstone of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. Here, I assumed the role of a data analyst working on the marketing team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes that the companies future depends upon maximizing the number of annual memberships. My goal was to answer the question: How do casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently? I used the data analysis process of Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act to answer key business questions, as well as I used the tools such as Excel,Tableau,and R programming language.
